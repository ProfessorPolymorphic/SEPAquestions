# Activity 2: Spatial Dynamics of Disease Spread

## Learning Objectives

-   Understand how the spatial distribution of a population affects the dynamics of disease spread.
-   Observe the impact of starting location on the spread of an infectious disease through a population.
-   Compare and contrast the outcomes of the simulation with those of a non-spatially structured model.

## Introduction to Spatial Structure in Epidemics

### The Importance of Geography

-   Diseases spread in a non-uniform manner, influenced by population density and movement patterns.
-   Spatial structure can lead to variability in transmission rates across different regions.

### 1918 Influenza as a Case Study

-   Highly infectious and widespread impact.
-   Varied effects across different regions due to population distribution.

## Setting Up the Simulation

### Simulation Parameters

-   **Disease:** 1918 Influenza virus strain.
-   **Starting Point:** Orlando, FL.
-   **Simulation Duration:** Defined time frame (e.g., 6 months).

### Visual Indicators

-   **SIEVR Graphs:** State-wise graphs showing Susceptible, Infected, Exposed, Vaccinated, and Recovered populations over time.
-   **Infection Spread:** Red color intensity on the map represents the level of infection.

## Running the Simulation (\~5 minutes)

### Interactive Features

-   Users can hover over each state to see a dynamic graph of the SIEVR values.
-   Watch the spread of infection in real-time as the simulation progresses.

### Observations
