# Activity 2: Spatial Dynamics of Disease Spread

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how the spatial distribution of a population affects the dynamics of disease spread.
- Observe the impact of starting location on the spread of an infectious disease through a population.
- Compare and contrast the outcomes of the simulation with those of a non-spatially structured model.


## Introduction to Spatial Structure in Epidemics

### The Importance of Geography

- Diseases spread in a non-uniform manner, influenced by population density and movement patterns.
- Spatial structure can lead to variability in transmission rates across different regions.

### 1918 Influenza as a Case Study

- Highly infectious and widespread impact.
- Varied effects across different regions due to population distribution.



## Setting Up the Simulation

### Simulation Parameters

- **Disease:** 1918 Influenza virus strain.
- **Starting Point:** Orlando, FL.
- **Simulation Duration:** Defined time frame (e.g., 6 months).

### Visual Indicators

- **SIEVR Graphs:** State-wise graphs showing Susceptible, Infected, Exposed, Vaccinated, and Recovered populations over time.
- **Infection Spread:** Red color intensity on the map represents the level of infection.



## Running the Simulation (~5 minutes)

### Interactive Features

- Users can hover over each state to see a dynamic graph of the SIEVR values.
- Watch the spread of infection in real-time as the simulation progresses.

### Observations

- **Speak Aloud** Note the speed of spread from the starting location.
- Observe the appearance of hotspots and variations in disease dynamics across states.



## Analysis of Simulation Outcomes

### Key Questions for Reflection

- How did the infection spread from the epicenter in Orlando, FL?
- What differences are noticeable compared to a non-spatial model?
- How did transport and local interactions contribute to the spread?


## Using Interactivity to Enhance Understanding

### Interactive Analysis

- Use the simulation's interactive elements to explore different aspects of the epidemic's progression.
- Answer guided questions based on observations from the simulation.

### Comparative Insight

- Discuss how the spatial model provides a different perspective on the epidemic compared to the basic SIR model. Provide a printed copy of the basic epidemic curve using a non spatial model.



## Activity Steps

1. Familiarize yourself with the 1918 influenza and its characteristics.
2. Run the spatial simulation starting from Orlando, FL.
3. Use the interactive map to observe the spread and evolution of the disease across states.
4. Reflect on how the spatial structure influenced the spread compared to a simple SIR model.
5. Complete a series of questions and prompts to solidify your understanding of spatial dynamics in disease spread.

## Post Test

Answer about 5 multiple choice questions that require data literacy tasks and interaction with the simulation.
