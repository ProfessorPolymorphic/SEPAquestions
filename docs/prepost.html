<h1>QUESTION BANK FOR PRE POST EVALUATION</h1>
<p>This question bank is currently composed of 61 multiple choice questions. They are arranged according to the learning objectives associated with each of the three activities.</p>
<p>The idea is that we would construct a matched pre and post test containing about 10 to 12 balanced but unique questions from eact activity.</p>
<p>Some of the data literacy oriented questions will have associated graphs that I must still generate.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>What is a key limitation of the basic SIR or SEIR models in infectious disease modeling?</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>They predict the exact time for disease eradication.</li>
<li>They assume a homogeneously mixing population.</li>
<li>They focus exclusively on airborne diseases.</li>
<li>They require real-time data for accurate predictions.</li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>
<p>Click to see the answer</p>
</summary>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> b) They assume a homogeneously mixing population.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> One of the main limitations of basic compartment models like SIR and SEIR is the assumption of homogeneous mixing within the population, which may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios where contact rates vary.</p>
</details></li>
<li><p><strong>Why might simple compartment models be inadequate for predicting real-world infectious disease spread?</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>They always overestimate the impact of vaccination.</li>
<li>They include too many disease-specific details.</li>
<li>They do not account for spatial or age-structured differences in populations.</li>
<li>They are only applicable for bacterial infections, not viral.</li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>
<p>Click to see the answer</p>
</summary>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> c) They do not account for spatial or age-structured differences in populations.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Simple compartment models often lack the complexity to account for spatial distribution and age-structured differences, which are crucial factors in the real-world spread of infectious diseases.</p>
</details></li>
<li><p><strong>Which aspect is often oversimplified in basic SIR and SEIR models?</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The rate of natural immunity development.</li>
<li>The impact of environmental factors on the disease.</li>

<li>The role of healthcare infrastructure in disease management.</li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>
<p>Click to see the answer</p>
</summary>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> c) Population dynamics, such as birth and death rates.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Basic SIR and SEIR models often simplify population dynamics by assuming a constant population without considering factors like birth, death, and migration rates, which can affect disease spread.</p>
</details></li>

<ol type="a">
<li>It neglects the impact of global travel on disease spread.</li>
<li>It overestimates the speed of vaccine development.</li>
<li>It assumes that all individuals have equal susceptibility.</li>
<li>It only considers the impact of the disease in urban areas.</li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>
<p>Click to see the answer</p>
</summary>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> a) It neglects the impact of global travel on disease spread.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The assumption of a closed population in basic models overlooks the effects of global travel and migration, which can significantly influence the spread and dynamics of infectious diseases.</p>

</ol>
<details>
<summary>
<p>Click to see the answer</p>
</summary>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> C. Individuals who have recovered from the disease and gained immunity.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In the SIR model, the ‘R’ compartment stands for ‘Recovered’. It represents individuals who have recovered from the disease and are assumed to have gained immunity against it.</p>
</details></li>
<li><p><strong>Which of the following is a critical assumption of the SIR model?</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Heterogeneous mixing of the population.</li>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> b) They become focal points for accelerated disease transmission.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When air travel is enabled in a disease spread simulation, major airports often become focal points for accelerated transmission, serving as hubs where the disease can spread rapidly to various destinations.</p>
</details></li>
<li><p><strong>What impact would restricting air travel likely have in a model of infectious disease spread?</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>It would significantly increase the rate of spread.</li>
<li>It would have no effect on the spread of the disease.</li>
<li>It would likely slow down the spread to distant areas.</li>
<li>It would change the pathogen’s virulence.</li>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> c) It would likely slow down the spread to distant areas.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Restricting air travel in a model of infectious disease spread would likely slow down the transmission to distant areas, as air travel is a key factor in rapid long-distance disease dissemination.</p>
</details></li>
<li><p><strong>What effect does international air travel have on the containment efforts of infectious diseases?</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>It enhances containment by limiting regional spread.</li>
<li>It complicates containment due to rapid global spread.</li>
<li>It has no impact on containment strategies.</li>
<li>It only affects containment in non-urban areas.</li>

</summary>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> B. It complicates containment due to rapid global spread.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> International air travel can significantly complicate the containment of infectious diseases by facilitating rapid global spread, making localized containment efforts less effective.</p>
</details></li>
<li><p><strong>In the air travel simulation, what impact do major airports have on regional disease dynamics?</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>They act as significant points of disease entry and spread.</li>
<li>They serve as effective quarantine zones.</li>
<li>They have minimal impact on disease dynamics.</li>
<li>They only affect cargo and goods, not people.</li>
</ol>
<details>

<p>Click to see the answer</p>
</summary>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A. They act as significant points of disease entry and spread.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Major airports in the air travel simulation act as crucial nodes for disease entry and spread, amplifying the dissemination of the disease to various regions.</p>
</details></li>
<li><p><strong>Compared to ground transport, how does air travel modify the geographical spread of a disease?</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>It leads to more evenly distributed spread.</li>
<li>It concentrates the disease in coastal regions.</li>
<li>It allows for rapid spread to distant and non-adjacent areas.</li>
<li>It restricts the disease to the hemisphere where it originated.</li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>
<p>Click to see the answer</p>
</summary>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> C. It allows for rapid spread to distant and non-adjacent areas.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Air travel significantly alters the geographical spread of a disease by enabling rapid transmission to distant and geographically non-adjacent areas, beyond the limitations of ground transport.</p>
</details></li>
<li><p><strong>In the simulation, how did the inclusion of air travel affect the timing of the disease’s spread?</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>It resulted in a slower initial spread.</li>
<li>It had no effect on the timing of spread.</li>
<li>It accelerated the initial spread to new regions.</li>
<li>It changed the spread only in the final stages.</li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>
<p>Click to see the answer</p>
</summary>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> C. It accelerated the initial spread to new regions.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The inclusion of air travel in the simulation significantly accelerated the initial spread of the disease, quickly reaching new regions that would have taken longer to be affected via ground transportation alone.</p>
</details></li>
<li><p><strong>Reflecting on the simulation, what role do air travel restrictions play in managing disease outbreaks?</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>They have no impact on the spread of diseases.</li>
<li>They are crucial for early-stage containment and slowing the spread.</li>
<li>They only affect the economic aspects of the outbreak.</li>
<li>They increase the spread due to overcrowding at airports.</li>
</ol>

<summary>
<p>Click to see the answer</p>
</summary>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> B. They are crucial for early-stage containment and slowing the spread.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Implementing air travel restrictions can be a critical strategy in the early stages of an outbreak, as it can significantly slow down the rapid global dissemination of the disease, aiding containment efforts.</p>
