# QUESTION BANK FOR PRE POST EVALUATION

This question bank is currently composed of 61 multiple choice questions.  They are arranged according to the learning objectives associated with each of the three activities.  

The idea is that we would construct a matched pre and post test containing about 10 to 12 balanced but unique questions from eact activity.

Some of the data literacy oriented questions will have associated graphs that I must still generate.
