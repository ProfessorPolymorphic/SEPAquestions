# Activity 1: Understanding Basic Compartment Models

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the structure and function of basic infectious disease compartment models, such as the SIR and SEIR models.
- Identify the critical assumptions underlying compartment models and their implications for modeling infectious disease spread.
- Recognize how compartment models can be used to predict disease dynamics and inform public health interventions.

---

## Slide 1: Introduction to Compartment Models

### What are Compartment Models?

- **Simplified frameworks** to understand infectious disease dynamics.
- Divide population into **compartments** representing disease states (e.g., Susceptible, Infected, Recovered).
- Use **mathematical equations** to describe the transitions between compartments.

---

## Slide 2: The SIR Model

### Exploring the SIR Model Structure

- **Susceptible (S):** Individuals who can contract the disease.
- **Infected (I):** Individuals who have contracted the disease and can spread it.
- **Recovered (R):** Individuals who have recovered and gained immunity.

### SIR Model Dynamics

- **Transition rates** determine how quickly individuals move from one compartment to another.

---

## Slide 3: Critical Assumptions of SIR Models

### Homogeneous Mixing

- Assumes every individual has an equal chance of coming into contact with an infected person.

### Constant Population

- Assumes no births, deaths (unrelated to the disease), or migration during the outbreak.

### Closed Population

- Assumes no new individuals enter the population, and no one leaves.

---

## Slide 4: Implications of SIR Model Assumptions

### Impact on Predictions

- **Over-simplification** can lead to inaccurate predictions.
- Important to consider modifications for different diseases or populations.

### Using Models Responsibly

- Understand the limitations and the context of the model.
- Use models as one tool among many for public health decision-making.

---

## Slide 5: Conclusion

### Compartment Models and Public Health

- Valuable for **estimating outbreak dynamics** and **evaluating control strategies**.
- Need to be used with an understanding of their assumptions and limitations.

### Next Steps

- Dive deeper into more complex models that consider age-structure, spatial distribution, and other factors.
- Reflect on how these models could apply to real-world scenarios.
