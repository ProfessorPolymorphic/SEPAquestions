# Activity 3: Impact of Air Travel on Disease Spread

## Learning Objectives

- Evaluate how the inclusion of air travel alters the spread of infectious diseases in a spatial model.
- Understand the role of transportation hubs in the dissemination of diseases.
- Assess the global reach of diseases with the incorporation of air travel into the simulation.

---

## Slide 1: Air Travel and Disease Dissemination

### Introduction to Air Travel in Epidemiological Modeling

- Air travel allows for rapid and long-distance transmission of diseases.
- Transportation hubs can act as amplifiers for disease spread.

### The 1918 Influenza with Air Travel

- Analyzing how air travel would have changed the spread of the 1918 influenza.
- Speculating on the global implications of such rapid dissemination.

---

## Slide 2: Setting Up the Air Travel Scenario

### Adjusting the Simulation

- Enable air travel in the simulation parameters.
- Maintain the initial infection point in Orlando, FL.

### Expected Changes

- Predicted faster spread to non-adjacent states and countries.
- Increased rate of outbreak in major transportation hubs.

---

## Slide 3: Observing the Simulation

### Interaction and Observation

- Monitor how the disease spread differs with the introduction of air travel.
- Observe the development of new hotspots and the speed of international spread.

### Documentation

- Document the time it takes for the infection to reach different regions.
- Compare this to the ground transportation model outcomes.

---

## Slide 4: Analyzing the Outcomes

### Key Analytical Questions

- How did air travel affect the speed and extent of the disease spread?
- What role did major airports play in the dissemination process?
- How does the spread pattern compare to the historical data of the 1918 influenza?

---

## Slide 5: Reflection on Modern Implications

### Contemporary Relevance

- Discuss modern examples where air travel facilitated the rapid spread of diseases.
- Reflect on the implications for public health policy and response strategies.

### The Importance of Modeling in Public Health

- Contemplate how accurate modeling can inform preventative measures and containment strategies during an outbreak.

## Activity Steps

1. Enable air travel in the simulation settings and initiate the spread from Orlando, FL.
2. Observe and document the spread pattern of the disease, focusing on the rate of spread and new hotspots.
3. Engage with the interactive map to see the specific effects of air travel on different states and countries.
4. Answer questions designed to encourage critical thinking about the role of air travel in disease dynamics.
5. Participate in a discussion on the findings and their implications for current and future infectious disease outbreaks.
